# Planning Phase
I tried to be as methodical as possible throughout development, starting with my planning phase. After our instructors provided us with a set of requirements for the web app, my first task was to draft a set of user stories to help focus my development phase. Some user stories I created include the following:

    (1) As a user, I will want to register my account so that I can play the game.
    (2) As a user, I will want to be able to edit my profile (email, password) to keep it up-to-date.
    (3) As a user, I want to be able to log in to a saved profile.
    (4) As a user, I want to be able to start a new game.
    (5) As a user, I will want to be able to view my past games so I can see how I've fared.
    (6) As a user, I want to know whose turn it is throughout the game.

My next step was to draft a ['wireframe'](https://imgur.com/mpHsxTV) to help visualize what my final product was going to be.

Finally, I then turned to the task of actually drafting my code.

# Development Phase
During development, I did my best to focus on one issue at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed. To that end, I did my best to stick to the following development schedule:

  (1) The first step I took was to create the code version of the tic-tac-toe board and the logic that drives the game.
  (2) My second step was to implement the GUI representation of my tic-tac-toe board and ensure that user manipulation would impact both the GUI and code versions of the tic-tac-toe board.
  (3) My third step was to implement the authentication process, ensuring that users could sign up, sign in, change their passwords, and sign-out.
  (4) My fourth major step was to implement game api requests, allowing for game creation/updates to be sent to the api and for users to request prior game information from the api.
  (5) My final major task was to implement stylistic edits.

Throughout the development phase, I did my best to maintain good branch/commit practices. This, along with careful implementation and step-by-step testing of my code, allowed me to troubleshoot bugs relatively quickly.

# Issues for Future Iterations
With greater deadline flexibility, I would've liked to have spent more time on  styling the web app. In addition, I would've also liked to have built out more funtionality for user requests; at the moment, users can request a full list of completed games, but I would like to allow them to make more directed requests (e.g., a succinct readout of how many games a user has won, etc.). Finally, I would like to make the game run across multiple platforms at the same time (as opposed to having both users play on the same platform).
